- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jakesmileydev
 
Hi I'm Jake,

I'm an aspiring web developer, currently working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'm currently focusing on learning Asynchronous JavaScript, Modules, and working with APIs.
Then I plan to get my hands dirty on some backend with Node, Express and MongoDB.

I'm still in the early stages of my development career, but I work hard and I love learning new things. I'm looking for a full time position where I can help create pixel perfect user experiences and learn new skills for the future.

You can reach me at: hello@jakesmiley.com
